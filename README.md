# I2C-Real-Time-Clock-with-PIC16F877A
This project shows how to interface a DS1307 real-time clock (RTC) module with a PIC16F877A microcontroller using the I2C protocol.
The system reads the current time and date from the RTC and displays it on an LCD screen.
The code is developed in MPLAB X IDE using the XC8 compiler, and the complete design is simulated in Proteus.
